# This setting is required for Canonical URLs.
# You can read more about why you should consider using this:
# https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/canonical-urls.html
#
# Until https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9781 is fixed,
# you need to define CUSTOM_CANONICAL_URL yourself as a workaround.
#
# For instance, navigate to Admin => Environment and define
# CUSTOM_CANONICAL_URL=https://SLUG.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
# (don't expose it to PRs, they publish on different URLs)
site_url: !ENV CUSTOM_CANONICAL_URL
